This Repo contains an example implementation of mcp. The weather.py represents the server part, the client_langchain.ipynb contains the client part of the mcp. 

Referred this repo by langchain for creating the client part : https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters/tree/main
And for the server: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server
